## CLI Tools
Installed: YYYY-MM-DD | Upgrade: `brew upgrade fd fzf bat htop tree yq ffmpeg wget`

- Use `fd` instead of `find` for file searches
- Use `bat` instead of `cat` when showing code to user
- Use `tree` for directory structure visualization
- Use `ffmpeg` directly for media tasks
- Use `yq` for YAML manipulation
- Use `htop` for process monitoring

Note: Generated scripts should use standard tools (find, cat, grep) for portability.
